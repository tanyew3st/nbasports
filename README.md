# Sports Prediction Betting Site for the NBA

Description / Motivation: Everyone loves supporting their favorite team and winning money; therefore, a relatively new sports betting industry has been rapidly growing, offering individuals with the ability to place money on a game subject to predetermined payouts. Prior to any sports game, namely the most popular ones, online quant shops and technological companies provide odds to Las Vegas casinos and betting sites that maximize individuals to spend money betting while ensuring that these brokers make money. Therefore, as large companies like Fanduel and DraftKings (among many others) reach tens of billion dollar  market caps, it begs the question of whether or not betting odds favor the user, casinos, or the odd providers - can the die hard sports fan or ESPN analyst beat the odds? Naturally, the answer is the casinos or else they would not be in business, but our project uses game outcomes in conjunction with their odds to understand how money moves in the sports betting industry.
